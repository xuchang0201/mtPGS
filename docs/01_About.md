GIFT is a Gene-based Integrative Fine-mapping for performing conditional TWAS analysis. GIFT examines one genomic region at a time, jointly models the GReX of all genes residing in the focal region, and carries out TWAS conditional analysis in a maximum likelihood framework. In the process, GIFT explicitly models the gene expression correlation and cis-SNP LD across different genes in the region and accounts for the uncertainty in the constructed GReX. As a result, GIFT provides effective type I error control, refines marginal TWAS associations into a much smaller set of putatively causal associations, and yields high statistical power with reduced false discoveries.
